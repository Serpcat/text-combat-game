/**
 * Text Combat : By Marco Luong 
 * 
 * Instructions / Notes : 
 * - Personally I find spamming attack and ultimate attack to ramp up damage in the first two floors would be helpful
 * - When your HP is low, heal up with an item and hope for the best
 * - In the boss stage, instead of ramping up more damage with ultimates, I find that it's more fun with the ultimate item (randomized spells)
 * 
 * Features : 
 * - 3 levels (ramping up in difficulty; 2 regular levels, one "boss"; SPOLIER: the boss isn't much different from the regular 
 *   mobs so no extra features other than it being super strong)
 * - Soft reset feature (when you faint and decide to go back to the first floor to train)
 * - Shop feature to buy equipment: money is gained based on HP left after the round is over, multiplied by the floor number
 * - Shield that decays
 * - Different items with different effects
 * - Ultimate forms of each action
 * 
 * Credit for borrowed code / assets : 
 * - A teacher for the general game method and play again format (do-while(playAgain()))
 * - A teacher for the valid input checkers (do-while(!validInput()))
 * - Ideas for poison, stun, critical hits from Pokemon games
